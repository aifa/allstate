--> Process each customer's transaction history.

--> Extract agreggates, variance, number of changes from the transaction history, 

--> Create a new dataset with one entry per customer and new features that express the transaction history information.

--> Find feature significance by:
	--> get covariance table.
	--> do feature exclusion from model creation.


--> Predict values of features that are significant and are not given in the test set. (ex. Predict final value, price variance etc.)

--> Predict final set of options.

--> Predict whether we can use the last product given in the test set as the final purchase or not(??????)
